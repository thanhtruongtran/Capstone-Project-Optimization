# Capstone-Project-Optimization
In our project, we initialize the "codes" folder to implement algorithms, produce results detail and use data in "data" folder.
After using checker in openerp website, we have updated our code that in "fix_codes" folder in order to fit the format of input and output and use data in "fix_data" folder.
You could check the results in Results.xlsx file.
Thanks you very much!!!
